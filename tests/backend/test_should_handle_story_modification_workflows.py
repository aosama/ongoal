TDD Test for Story Follow-up Goals Backend Logic

Tests the scenario:
1. Initial complex message: storytelling elements + story creation with specific requirements
2. Follow-up message: "make the story shorter" 
3. Verify that follow-up goals are properly captured and merged

Uses LLM-based semantic assertions instead of keyword matching for robust testing.

Following TDD: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR

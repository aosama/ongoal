"""
Test Goal Merge Operations Compliance with OnGoal Requirements

Verifies that the merge stage correctly implements the three operations:
1. Replace: New goal contradicts old goal -> replace old with new
2. Combine: New goal similar to old goal -> merge them into combined goal  
3. Keep: Goal is unique -> keep it unchanged

Uses both structural verification and LLM semantic assertions.

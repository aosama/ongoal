TDD Tests for Backend Goal Merge Logic

Tests the three merge operations according to OnGoal white paper:
- Replace: New goal contradicts old goal -> replace old with new
- Combine: New goal similar to old goal -> merge them into combined goal  
- Keep: Goal is unique -> keep it unchanged

Following TDD: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
